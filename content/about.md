### Hello, our names are Cameron Fryer and John Riley McLaughlin. Thank you for visiting our website, and stay tuned for updates. 

#### In the meantime, here are the lyrics to Beachin' by Jake Owen. JR was the first person to ever show the song to Cameron, and thank God he did! Great tune!

Just watching her blonde hair, sun burn, stare at them  
Whitecaps rolling over  
Laid back in a thrift store beach chair  
Dropping limes in her Corona  
Well she looks back, yeah, she throws me a kiss  
Like "Honey, I sure want you"  
And it's a hundred and three between her and me  
And only 92 in Daytona

And it's sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, it's low tide  
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand, just a summertime strollin'  
Chillin', breezin', sippin', singin' whoa-oh-oh  
Beachin'

We got two-for-ones, we're at a margarita bar  
Whatever happens happens  
And there's a reggae band, full of dread heads  
Just sittin' in the corner laughin'  
Well my baby walks over, drops a 20 in a jar  
She smiles and shakes it at me  
Yeah, she gets 'em going, she gets 'em playing  
A little, don't worry, be happy

And it's sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, it's low tide  
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand, just a summertime strollin'  
Chillin', breezin', sippin', singin' whoa-oh-oh  
Beachin'

Ah yeah  
Lil' palm tree leanin'  
I got a margarita in my hand, I'm doin' a little drinkin'

Talking 'bout  
Sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, it's low tide  
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand, just a summertime strollin'  
Chillin', breezin', sippin', singin' whoa-oh-oh  
Beachin' (aw, we're just beachin')

Sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, it's low tide (under the palm tree leanin')  
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand

# P.S. A HUGE Thank you goes out to both Nikki and Emma. We appreciate you :)
