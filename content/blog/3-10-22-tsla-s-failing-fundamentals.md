$TSLA remains one of the most speculative & overvalued stocks in this current NASDAQ bear market. Currently, the stock is trading at $813, & its P/E is 165 (Healthy levels are 20-25). With rates rising, the days of high PE valuations are coming to an end rather quickly.

If TSLA was trading $100, its PE would be a healthy 20-- Which is ultimately where I see this going.

In the face of QE officially ending on 3/9/22 & at least a 25 BPS hike coming on the 16th during the Federal Reserve's meeting, I am holding long OTM #Puts against this high-flying pig of a stock.

3/18/22 $510, 6/17/2022 $350, & 1/20/23 $5 Puts.

TSLA is currently trading in a bearish megaphone pattern & could revisit the low 600s rather soon. Stay tuned!
