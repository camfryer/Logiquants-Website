<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Welcome to my review on the best brokerages in Canada. I will be focusing on the overall features that each brokerage has to offer. While **Qtrade**, **TD Direct Investing**, and **Questrade** are the best options for many Canadians, a sophisticated investor may be better off using a different brokerage. Feel free to contact me at cameron@logiquants.ca with any questions or concerns.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">The brokerage that I consider to be **best in Canada is Qtrade**. Although there are brokerages that charge less in commission fees, Qtrade is worth the extra costs. Not only do they have the best customer service out of every brokerage, but they also have a couple of different offers available. Before getting into the offer details, I should note that Qtrade's commission fees are still less than most of the big banks. This can be seen in the table below, through comparison to TD Direct investing.</span></span>

<table>
<tr>  
<td> </td> <th>Qtrade  </th> <th>TD Direct Investing  </th> <th>Questrade</th> </tr> <tr> <th>Stocks</th> <td>$8.75</td> <td>$9.99</td> <td>1¢/share (min. $4.95 to max. $9.95)</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Options</th> <td>$8.75 + $1.25 per contract</td> <td>$9.99 + $1.25 per contract</td> <td>$9.95 + $1 per contract</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Mutual Funds  </th> <td>Free</td> <td>Free</td> <td>$9.95</td> </tr> <tr> <th>ETFs</th> <td>Free buy/sell for select list of 100+ ETFs, $8.75 otherwise</td> <td>$9.99</td> <td>Buy for free, sell for 1¢/share (min. $4.95 to max. $9.95)</td> </tr> </table>

###### **Important Note:** the prices in the table above are available to all investors. In addition to these prices, Qtrade, TD Direct Investing and Questrade also offer _active trader_ plans that come with reduced commission fees. There are specific requirements that need to be met to hold an active trader plan. To find more detail, please visit the respective brokerage's website.

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Now, back to those offers with Qtrade. First, if you "Open a new account with promo code 50TRADESFREE and transfer in at least $10,000 by August 31, 2022," you can receive up to 50 free trades (a value of roughly $500). Additional conditions apply (full details of the promotion can be found at [https://www.qtrade.ca/en/investor/offers/free-trades-offer.html](https://www.qtrade.ca/en/investor/offers/free-trades-offer.html "here")). Secondly, for investors in the range of 18-30 years old, Qtrade offers "Young investor pricing." In order to qualify, one must pre-authorize automatic contributions of $50 or more per month to a Qtrade investment account. What are the benefits? Wellinclude $7.75 commissions for stock and ETF trades</span></span>
