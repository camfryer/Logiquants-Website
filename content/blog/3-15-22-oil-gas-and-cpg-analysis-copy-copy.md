<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Welcome to my review on the best brokerages in Canada. I will be focusing on the overall features that each brokerage has to offer. While **Qtrade**, **TD Direct Investing**, and **Questrade** are the best options for many Canadians, a sophisticated investor may be better off using a different brokerage. Feel free to contact me at cameron@logiquants.ca with any questions or concerns.</span></span>

### Pick #1: Qtrade

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">The brokerage that I consider to be **best in Canada is Qtrade**. Although there are brokerages that charge less in commission fees, Qtrade is worth the extra costs. Not only do they have the best customer service out of every brokerage, but they also have a couple of different offers available. Before getting into the offer details, I should note that Qtrade's commission fees are competitive with most of the big banks. As an example, refer to the table below for a comparison to TD Direct Investing.</span></span>

<table>
<tr>  
<td> </td> <th>Qtrade  </th> <th>TD Direct Investing  </th> <th>Questrade</th> </tr> <tr> <th>Stocks</th> <td>$8.75</td> <td>$9.99</td> <td>1¢/share (min. $4.95 to max. $9.95)</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Options</th> <td>$8.75 + $1.25/contract</td> <td>$9.99 + $1.25/contract</td> <td>$9.95 + $1/contract</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Mutual Funds  </th> <td>$8.75</td> <td>Free</td> <td>$9.95</td> </tr> <tr> <th>ETFs</th> <td>Free buy/sell for select list of 100+ ETFs, $8.75 otherwise</td> <td>$9.99</td> <td>Buy for free, sell for 1¢/share (min. $4.95 to max. $9.95)</td> </tr> </table>

###### **Important Note:** the prices in the table above are available to all investors. In addition to these prices, Qtrade, TD Direct Investing and Questrade also offer active trader plans that come with reduced commission fees. There are specific requirements that need to be met to hold an active trader plan. To find more detail, please visit the respective brokerage's website.

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Now, back to those offers with Qtrade. First, if you "Open a new account with promo code 50TRADESFREE and transfer in at least $10,000 by August 31, 2022," you can receive up to 50 free trades (a value of roughly $500).<sup>1</sup> Additional conditions apply (full details of the promotion can be found [here](https://www.qtrade.ca/en/investor/offers/free-trades-offer.html)). Secondly, for investors in the range of 18-30 years old, Qtrade offers "Young investor pricing."<sup>2</sup> To qualify, one must setup automatic contributions of $50 or more per month to a Qtrade investment account. What are the benefits of this offer? No account administration fees and a reduced commission fee of $7.75 on stocks, ETFs and mutual funds (full details of the offer can be found [here](https://www.qtrade.ca/en/investor/pricing/offers.html)).</span></span>

#### Final Notes on Qtrade<sup>3</sup>:

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">**‣** No minimum amount is required to open an account</span></span>  
<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">**‣** There is an account administration fee of $25/quarter. It will be waived if you meet at least one of the following conditions:</span></span>

1. **◦** You hold $25,000+ in assets  
   **◦** You made 2+ equity/option trades in the prior quarter  
   **◦** You made 8+ equity/option trades in the prior 12-month period  
   **◦** You contribute $100+ to your investment account monthly  
   **◦** You qualify for the Young investor offer
2. 

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">**‣** Additional fees are charged for US dollar registered accounts (TFSA, RSP & RIF)</span></span>  
<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">     **◦** The fees are $15 USD/quarter for each account</span></span>  
<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">**‣** Qtrade will pay the transfer-out fees ($150 max.) of those transferring $15,000+</span></span>

### Pick #2: TD Direct Investing

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">The **second best brokerage in Canada is TD Direct Investing**. I would like to emphasize, however, that it's a **tight comparison between Qtrade and TD**. In fact, I would rank TD as best brokerage in Canada if they improved their customer service. Two big advantages that TD has over Qtrade are that there are no fees for holding US dollar registered accounts, and there are no fees on mutual fund transactions. For those who regularly invest in mutual funds and/or hold a US dollar TFSA, RSP or RIF, these cost differences will add up significantly over time. But time is money, and if you're a TD Direct Investing client, you will learn that lesson the hard way. Personally, I would rather lose a few extra dollars in fees than lose my time waiting on the phone.</span></span>

#### Final Notes on TD Direct Investing<sup>4</sup>:

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">**‣** No minimum amount is required to open an account</span></span>

1. **◦** The TD Direct Investing accounts belonging to your Canadian household have combined assets of $15,000+ (this can include your accounts **AND** those of friends, family, roommates, etc.)  
   **◦** You set up a monthly pre-authorized deposit/contribution or Systematic Investment Plan of $100+ for at least one of the accounts in your Canadian household  
   **◦** The investing accounts belonging to your household made a combined 3+ trades in the prior quarter  
   **◦** There's a Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) account belonging to your household
2. 

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">**‣** TD will pay transfer-out fees of up to $150 for those transferring $25,000+ to a new investing account (max. 4 transfers/client)</span></span>
