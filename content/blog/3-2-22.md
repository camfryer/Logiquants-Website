Recently, Russian ETF $RSX collapsed to single digits as Russia waged its war Ukraine.

My Play: Hypothetically if China sides with Russia economically or militarily, there may be financial consequences to their equities as well. The $FXI ETF is China Large Cap names which have been uninvestable for quite some time now. I like spreading some risk between 2 dates.

6/17/22 ... 1/20/23 .... FXI could potentially see single digits.
