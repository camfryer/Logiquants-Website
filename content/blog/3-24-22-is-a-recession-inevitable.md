There was an interesting article released yesterday. It's titled "The Fed is facing a lose-lose situation with either hot inflation or a recession, but high prices would be preferable, says Mohamed El-Erian." Though I agree about the lose-lose situation, I believe that a recession would be preferable. After all, time is money, isn't it?

It's time for us to consider the logistics of this scenario. With higher inflation, asset owners gain wealth simply by holding onto their belongings. Thus, individuals without many assets are extremely disadvantaged. Not only does inflation make them less wealthy than those who own assets, but inflation makes it more difficult to even afford an asset (due to higher prices). More often than not, owning assets also enables you to save money on items that would otherwise be considered an expense. For example, if you own a home, you don't need to pay rent, and if you own a car, you don't need to rent a vehicle.

What would you do if you were to race cars against your friend Kyle, but Kyle's car had a speed boost, Kyle got a 40-foot head start, and your car's speed boost didn't activate until you were within 20 feet of Kyle's car? There's no point in even trying. Kyle wins. That's the exact point I'm trying to get at...If inflation continues to get worse, Millennials and Gen Z's will be in this scenario. Only instead of a car race, it's their LIFE! Many young people will give up on reaching their financial goals as they begin to feel out of reach. *_EDIT*_ This will ultimately lead to even more people resigning from their jobs, both furthering the Great Resignation, and putting the economy into a recession.

While some readers may think the outcome described above is an over-exaggeration, note that Millennials have amassed "less \[wealth\] than older generations had at the same age." Yet, "Millennials have surpassed Baby Boomers as the nationâ€™s largest living adult generation." *_EDIT*_
