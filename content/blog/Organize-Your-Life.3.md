Two stocks I've been short using long dated puts since October 31st, 2021 are $TSLA & $SQ . These are two stocks that are extremely popular among the retail trading crowd & are also held in large quantities/ heavily weighted in Cathie Wood's $ARKK ETF. ( [https://ark-funds.com/funds/arkk/](https://ark-funds.com/funds/arkk/ "https://ark-funds.com/funds/arkk/") ). Cathie's ETF is notorious for being composed of high growth, overvalued, speculative tech names... Many of which resemble the high flying stocks of the 2000 dot com era. ([https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/reddit-trends/cathie-woods-ark-innovation-etf-what-a-bubble-looks-like](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/reddit-trends/cathie-woods-ark-innovation-etf-what-a-bubble-looks-like "https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/reddit-trends/cathie-woods-ark-innovation-etf-what-a-bubble-looks-like") )

I can't  totally disparage ARKK's strategy because it was an extremely successful hold for a period of time. But without interest rates remaining at 0% & the Fed constantly expanding its balance sheet, the 'game' Cathie was playing doesn't work long term. The Fed will be changing the rules of the game when they increase the cost of borrowing money in a few weeks, & the ARKK will continue sinking.

With rate hikes expected to rise between 25 & 50 bps at the  Fed's Board meeting on March 16th, staying in names with overvalued P/E's is just playing a high stakes game of musical chairs. When the music's turned off (rates rise), you don't want to be the main street investor who overpaid by 5x & are forced to wait years to break even.

My ultimate goal is to ensure my capital is spread among many  investment positions that can be justified on a combination of their fundamentals (Business' performance/health) , technicals (Charts), or catalysts in the news (Institutional Algo's key on certain headlines & bid stocks to moon). By having an understanding of the relationship between these elements, I'm able to put money to work in an opportunistic fashion & with peace of mind in our volatile world.

By the end of the year, I believe $ARKK will go < $32.50 & $TSLA will see < $375 as borrowing money becomes much more difficult The fundamentals & technicals also suggest both price targets are very well within the realm of possibility. I'm also playing mid June expirations to test my thesis that the market crash will happen in the 1st half of this year.

Cheers,

JR
