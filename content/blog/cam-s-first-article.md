Everybody's talking about it lately - prices at the pumps are sky high! Although they have fallen since last week and could continue to short term, I'm confident gas prices will rise medium and long term. Yes, interest rates are increasing and asset prices should decrease accordingly. But there are additional factors to consider with oil and gas.

Before diving in, let's first remind ourselves what increasing interest rates mean for the economy as a whole: less money in circulation. With less money circulating in the economy, the population will have less money at their disposal than they previously did. In other words, members of the population will be forced to make choices about where they spend their money. This is basic economics - limited resources and unlimited wants.

With that said, ask yourself where you think the average consumer spends their money. According to Statistics Canada's numbers from 2019, transportation accounted for roughly 13.6% of all household spending.<sup>1</sup> But these numbers are from before the Covid-19 Pandemic, and a lot has happened since then. For example, many people living in cities headed for the suburbs and more rural places to live.

Now that Covid-19 mandates are coming to an end, much of the workforce will be required to commute to work again. For those who ditched urban living, this means a longer commute to work and more money spent on gas (assuming they don't own an electric vehicle, like most Canadians). On top of that, Ontario is currently administering shortened G license road tests to handle the huge "backlog caused by COVID-19 restrictions and closures."<sup>2</sup> This will cause an influx of new drivers on the road over the next couple of months.

Between longer commutes to work and additional drivers on the road, there will be a lot more gas needed. Gas is made from crude oil. Pair the increase in its demand with the United States of America's ban on Russian oil imports, and we have a recipe for prices to increase. After all, the United States will need to import extra oil from somewhere, and Canada is a likely source. Finally, I believe consumers would forgo other goods and services to maintain the role that transportation plays in their lives, rather than use less gas.

From an investment perspective, my favourite company in the Oil and Gas sector is Crescent Point Energy Corp ($CPG). In fact, I'm biased, as I'm an investor myself. Crescent Point is an exploration and production company based in Calgary, Alberta.
