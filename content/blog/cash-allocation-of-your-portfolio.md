With the state of the markets today and the decline over the last few months, I suggest that LogiQuants followers keep a significant portion of cash on the sideline. More specifically, I would recommend keeping somewhere in the range of 25-50% of your investment portfolio as cash. As I have said before, time is money. There is a very high chance that the market will continue to decline, and having cash readily available means you can snag good opportunities when they arise. This can impact ROI (Return on Investment) significantly, given the turbulence of today's economy. To illustrate my point, consider the following example:

Joshua would like to buy shares of Company A at the current price of $5 each, as he believes it's a good opportunity. His cash is tied up, however, in a Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) paying 1.5% annually. By the time the GIC matures and Joshua has the money to purchase shares of company A, the shares have gained 10% without him (they now cost $5.50 each).
