<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">With the state of the markets today and the decline over the last few months, I suggest that LogiQuants followers keep a significant portion of cash on the sideline. More specifically, I would recommend keeping somewhere in the range of 25-50% of your investment portfolio as cash. As I have said before, time is money. There is a very high chance that the market will continue to decline, and having cash readily available means you can snag good opportunities when they arise. This can impact ROI (Return on Investment) significantly, given the turbulence of today's economy. To illustrate my point, consider the following example:</span></span>

Joshua would like to buy shares of Company A at the current price of $5 each, as he believes it's a good opportunity. His cash is tied up, however, in a Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) paying 1.5% annually. By the time the GIC matures and Joshua has the money to purchase shares of company A, the shares have gained 10% without him (they now cost $5.50 each).

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Joshua would have been better off by holding more cash in his portfolio rather than investing it in a GIC. That way, he could have bought shares of company A at $5.00 instead of $5.50. In today's markets, scenarios like Joshua's can take place within a single day. From a risk standpoint, this changes how the optimal portfolio should be allocated in 2022 versus how it was allocated in the past. It's more important than ever to make sure you have enough cash on hand for all the _what-ifs_.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">On a final note, you also don't want too much of your portfolio to be cash. With too much cash, you risk subjecting yourself to inflation risk (i.e., the risk that inflation reduces the purchasing power of your money). It's important to find the right balance. For someone whose investment portfolio consists of a million dollars or more, 50% cash is likely too much. But for someone with $2000 to invest, holding 50% cash might make sense. It depends on individual circumstances. For specific advice tailored to your own investment needs, please consult an investment advisor.</span></span>
