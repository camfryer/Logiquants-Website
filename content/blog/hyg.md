On March 11, 2022, the S&P500 officially death crossed for the first time since March 2020. This 'Death Cross' takes place when the 50-day moving average crosses beneath the 200-day moving average. It not only signals bearish momentum in the market, but in recent history, it also triggered the federal reserve to cut interest rates and print more money to keep equity prices 'stable'. However, this time their choice may actually be different.

With inflation at 40-year highs, the Fed doesn't have a choice but to slam on the breaks & hike rates while equities are falling simultaneously. 

This action will hurt the valuations of companies that are either unprofitable &/or rely on forwarding earnings to justify their high valuations.  

Tomorrow, 3/16/22 is the FOMC meeting where the federal reserve will finally be raising rates. Let's see if stocks can weather the rate hike in the face of global geopolitical uncertainties.

Cheers,
