Oil/gas/fire combustion technology began in the 1800s. Its ancient technology because this form of propulsion has been around for hundreds of years. The likelihood of having found more frictionless forms of propulsion technology is very very high. If not certain given Moore’s Law. Technology & Intelligence go hand in hand.

As an aviation lover, I constantly find myself googling stories related to the new technology that exists in this field. For example, the unreleased SR-72 is speculated to be powered by a hypersonic propulsion system that could allow it to travel at speeds up to Mach 17. Hypothetically, travel from New York to London would only take 30 minutes.

Furthermore, the UAP propulsion system is even more advanced. But nobody has publicly made a claim to the technology. In case you’re not familiar with this UAP phenomenon, there are numerous articles published citing primary sources (Naval airman) these UAPs have been spotted off the coast of Virginia every day for 2 years in restricted airspace.

I personally have concluded the likelihood of it being American technology is high. Could this be our modern-day “Manhattan project” in the face of a potential WW3? That could make sense. History has shown America always keeps _something_ in its back pocket, just in case. As Sun Tzu says, “Every battle is won before it’s fought.”

Could the UAP be an adversaries technology? Of course it could be. My western lens is admittedly biased by my experiences & belief system. I’m obviously rooting heavily for the United States. From my point of view, China is not an overly innovative country. They rely on reverse engineering and intellectual property theft/hacking to advance. Furthermore, as we have seen in Ukraine, Russia’s military logistics appear sloppy and uncoordinated. Based on their long history in space with America, Russia would be more likely to possess UAP capabilities than China. Outside of those two nations, the owners of UAP technology could be either aliens or America. The rational conclusion to draw is America unless you believe aliens are coming to visit the planet soon.

It’s a commonly held belief that the technology in the hands of the public is normally 20-30 years behind what’s being researched & developed by our space & military programs. One can look at all of the technology the public benefited from by NASA’s trips to the moon & outer space in the 1960s to know this is true. Therefore, my guess is that within at least the next 30 years MAX ( possibly much sooner), oil/ gas are most likely going to be obsolete. $0. This hypothesis is all based on the UAP technology eventually working on behalf of the good of the public (world) & not being entirely used for national defense purposes. Again, aliens could be real too. Who knows.

The jump humanity will make transitioning from the Oil/Gas model to hypersonic/ UAP type propulsion will be an even bigger jump than mankind made as they transitioned from horses to cars. There are many many pros & cons of this technology existing. The economic implications of this propulsion system would instantly erase millions of transportation & energy jobs. But it could also be an incredible tool for preserving our environment & working in a deflationary fashion. (Products produced & transported fast/ cheaper = less expensive goods).

However, logistically speaking, neither our current western societal structures nor monetary systems are built for this type of technological advancement I’m hypothesizing could take place. Neither are the economies of some very important, authoritarian, global powers.

I believe this technology could even retire capitalism as we know it. “With great power comes great responsibility.” Technology like this should be wielded to give back to humans & the planet. Not take from both. Capitalism = taking from the weak to give to the strong. Hence the insanely massive wealth gap & great resignation the United States faces in 2022. This transition away from capitalism could be a necessary requirement— Similar to the transition away from the “gold standard” in 1971 which enabled money to expedite the exponential growth of technology. (Printing $ is a fast forward button). $= GDP. GDP = Time. Technology likely forces us to find a new system of governance. Or the masses will continue to be at the mercy of a few powerful players which is ancient, caveman behavior.

The problem with a push for advancements in technology/ propulsion: Oil producing countries.

Most Americans / Europeans would regard a majority of the OPEC counties as evil players. Authoritarian dictatorships, some of which possess nuclear weapons. Economies that are almost entirely dependent on oil/ gas likely have no place in the future I’m describing unless they’re able to abandon a large chunk of their identities (Oil). What value will these countries bring to the world without oil? Many are stuck fighting wars on beliefs thousands of years old. Without oil, do we expect these same players to suddenly stop fighting? Doubtful.

If I am to insert myself into the shoes of these OPEC-Esq players—full of greed/ women oppressing/ journalist killing/ nursery bombing/ chemical weapons/ biological weapons using foes (China, Russia, UAE, Saudi Arabia, IRAN, Syria, Venezuela, etc.— Counties which have been making their alliances very clearly in 2022), would I attempt to hold the world hostage & force them to continue using my caveman technology? Probably. By clinging to this old technology as a form of dependence, these players ultimately prevent the world from transitioning into a new age. This hostage scenario could be something that’s already been going on for years & as a private citizen, I’m oblivious too. Maybe it’s all coming to a head very soon? Certainly seems likely.

Should the fact many of these countries have nuclear capabilities worry NATO? Of course. Leaders will have to dance carefully both diplomatically & if it comes down to it, militarily.

Today, China is in the process of making a very difficult decision. Will China choose their alliance based on the autocratic/ dictatorship governments of the modern “Axis of Evil/ Oil dependent nations”, or will they choose the right side of history— Progress & innovation. Peace. Love. The “golden age of technology.” Maybe the future even allows China to keep some of its authoritarian characteristics. (The WEF’s Davo’s agenda certainly suggests this is possible worldwide with a collaboration of private & public players). Ultimately, the door is wide open for China to choose its own destiny. I hope they choose goodness.

Could technology ultimately be pushing mankind toward the theme of “A brotherhood of man”? The same theme John Lennon played on in his song “Imagine”? I’d like to think so. That gives me hope for our future. A future founded on love.

Love conquerors all. Love doesn’t require a fact checker & isn’t confused as misinformation. It’s transparent. It’s easy to feel. I sure hope that’s what’s our future is built on & sure hope I find my role to play in it.

Cheers,

JR
