he combustion of fossil fuels has been used as the primary input for propulsion systems dating as far back as the early 1800s. Converting fossil fuels into harnessable energy is a relatively ancient practice. Although propulsion systems of trains, planes, and automobiles have become more efficient over time, mankind continues to use an unsustainable quantity which comes at a great cost to the earth & its inhabitants. The likelihood of having discovered more powerful, less wasteful forms of propulsion technology in the last 200 years is nearly certain especially given what we know about Moore's Law. The exponential growth of computing power = exponential growth of intelligence. (Ex. Artificial Intelligence).

As an aviation lover, I often find myself googling stories related to the new technology being developed in this field. For example, the next-generation spy plane, the SR-72, is speculated to have a hypersonic propulsion system that would allow it to travel at Mach 6. ([Has the mystery plane been revealed?](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2607840/Is-THIS-SR-72-spy-plane-Mystery-aircraft-spotted-flying-Kansas-just-weeks-seen-Texas.html) )

Engineers one day hope to build vessels that travel Mach 17.

Furthermore, the UAP propulsion system is even more advanced & fascinating. In case you are not familiar with this "UAP" phenomenon, there have been numerous articles published citing both military & civilian sources. These UAPs were spotted off the coast of Virginia every day for two years in restricted airspace.

[For some Navy pilots, UFO sightings were an ordinary event: 'Every day for at least a couple years'](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/05/17/ufo-sightings-navy-ryan-graves/)

The UAP's unique propulsion system has also been spotted by American Airlines pilots.

Although nobody has publicly claimed the technology yet, I do not believe the UAPs are holographs, propaganda, or misinformation as some critics believe.

I have personally concluded the likelihood of the UAP propulsion system being American technology is rather high. Could this be our modern-day “Manhattan project” in the face of a potential WW3? History has shown America always keeps _something_ in its back pocket, just in case. As Sun Tzu, author of _The Art of War_, says, “Every battle is won before it is fought.”

Could the UAP be an adversaries technology? Of course, it could be, but here is why I believe that is unlikely. China is not an overly innovative country. They mostly rely on reverse engineering and intellectual property theft (hacking) to advance themselves. Furthermore, as we have seen in Ukraine, Russia’s military logistics & communication appear very uncoordinated. Based on Russia's long history in space, Russia would be more likely to possess UAP capabilities than China. Outside of those two nations, one is left to conclude the technology belongs to either aliens or The United States. Perhaps you believe in aliens. I do not.

It is a commonly held belief that the technology in the hands of the public is typically 20-30 years behind the capabilities of our space & military programs. For example, just google all of the technology built after NASA’s trips to space in the 1960s. Therefore, my best guess is within at least the next 30 years, combusting fossil fuels for energy could become nearly obsolete. This hypothesis is based on the UAP technology eventually working on behalf of the good of the public & not being entirely used for national defense purposes. Again, aliens could be real too. Who knows?

The jump humanity will make transitioning from fossil fuel reliance to hypersonic or UAP type propulsion systems will be an even more life-altering leap than humans made as we transitioned from horses to cars. There are many pros & cons of this technology existing. The economic implications of this propulsion system would erase millions of transportation & energy jobs. However, it could also be an incredible tool for preserving our environment & working in a deflationary fashion to bring the cost of everyday goods down.

Unfortunately, several factors are preventing this technology from being implemented anytime soon. Logistically speaking, neither our current western societal structures nor monetary systems are built for the type of technological advancement. Neither are the economies of important, authoritarian, global powers in both the far east & middle east.

I believe the advancements in propulsion & technology can even 'retire' capitalism as we know it. “With great power comes great responsibility.”- Uncle Ben to Spiderman.

Technology this efficient ought to be wielded to give back to humans & the planet. Not take from both at all costs. At its core, capitalism = the strong exploiting the weak. Skeptical? Just look at the $30T fiscal deficit, the massive wealth gap, and the continued great resignation the United States faces in 2022. This system is damaging more than it is assisting. This transition away from capitalism might even be a necessity if mankind wishes to continue evolving alongside the exponential advancements in technology. A necessary transition similar to the transition made when we decided to abandon the 'gold standard' in 1971. This decision enabled money to expedite the growth of technology. (Printing unlimited $ is a fast forward button. $= GDP. GDP = Time.) The continuous evolution of technology will likely force the United States to adopt a new system of governance. This is where the argument for stakeholder capitalism vs. surveillance capitalism can be made. How long will the majority allow themselves to be exploited by a few powerful groups of surveillance capitalists/authoritarian governments to perpetuate financial greed?

Another problem with a push for advancements in propulsion & technology is the OPEC allies. Many Americans & Europeans regard a majority of the OPEC allies as _evil_ nations. These players are authoritarians, some of which possess nuclear weapons. The economies of these players that are almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels likely have no place in the future I am describing unless they abandon a large chunk of their identities. What value will these countries bring to the world without fossil fuels? Many are stuck fighting wars based on beliefs thousands of years old. Without oil, do we expect these same nations to suddenly stop fighting?

If I put myself into the belief systems of the OPEC / OPEC allied nations (China, Russia, U.A.E., Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Brazil, Venezuela, etc.), would I attempt to hold the world hostage & force them to continue using my ancient technology & resources? Most likely. By holding on to this ancient form of energy, the systems of these nations ultimately prevent the world from transitioning into a new age of evolution. This 'hostage' scenario could be something that has already been going on for years. As a private citizen, I simply do not have enough context. Maybe this divide is all coming to a head very soon? Should the fact many of these countries have nuclear capabilities worry NATO? Of course. Western leaders will have to dance carefully diplomatically & potentially militarily as a last resort.

Today, China is in the process of making a difficult decision. Will China choose their alliance based on the autocratic/ dictatorship governments of the modern “Axis of Evil/ Oil centric nations", or will they choose the right side of history? — Progress & innovation. Peace. Love. The “golden age of technology.” Maybe the future even allows China to keep some of its authoritarian characteristics. (The WEF’s Davo’s agenda certainly suggests this is possible worldwide with a collaboration of private & public entities). Ultimately, the door is wide open for China to choose its destiny. I hope they choose goodness. Surely we can find a sustainable way to peacefully coexist.

Could advancements in technology ultimately be propelling mankind to embrace the theme of “A brotherhood of man”? (The main theme in John Lennon's song "Imagine") I think so. That gives me hope for our future. A future founded on love.

Love conquerors all. Love does not require a fact checker & is not confused for misinformation. Love is transparent. Love is easy to feel. I hope our future is built on a transparent foundation, & I hope I find my role to play in it all.
