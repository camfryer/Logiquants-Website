<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">The stock I'm writing about today is one that I've been keeping my eye on for over 2 years. I've been patiently waiting for the right chance to buy it. With such a good opportunity coming available at a time when buying gold makes sense, I couldn't resist purchasing it any longer. So what company did I buy shares of? A small-cap gold miner named Iamgold Corp (TSX: IMG). Iamgold Corp is a Canada-based company with operations in West Africa, North America and South America. The company is responsible for exploring, developing and operating different gold mining projects.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">The number one thing that stuck out to me about Iamgold is the graph of its stock price. The all-time low for shares of IMG is $1.50 and the all-time high is $23.33. Seeing as the company has been around for more than 20 years, and the current price per share is only $1.83, what is there to lose with this investment? Even if the stock price did continue to fall to all-time lows (i.e. below $1.50), you wouldn't be down much. You could cut your losses and move on if it came to it. Conversely, think about the possibilities if the stock price goes in the other direction, and you bought in at $1.83. Even if shares of IMG get nowhere near the all-time high of $23.33, if they increased to $3.66/share, for instance, you will have doubled your money. This is a stellar investment opportunity, as it presents little risk and potential for a big reward.</span></span>

<span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.2em;">Although IMG is an attractive investment from a price standpoint, some of the company's financial statements highlight the risk involved. More specifically, Iamgold's annual net income for 2021 was about -254 million dollars. While this has improved in 2022, the company still has a lot of work to do. The reported net income for the first quarter of 2022 was only 23.8 million dollars. Regarding earnings, Iamgold has blown estimates out of the water over the last 2 quarters. With that in mind, remember that the trend is your friend! If Iamgold keeps on track with recent earnings reports, we can expect good news from the next one, ideally making the company's net income less of a concern. Consequently, the company's Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $-0.68 would also improve. With a price-to-earnings ratio of -2.7x, an increase in Iamgold's EPS would significantly impact investors' views on both the value and growth cases for shares of IMG. For that reason, I bought IMG stock today, and there's a good chance I will buy more.</span></span>
